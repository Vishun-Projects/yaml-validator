# üöÄ Audit Validator - Groq AI Integration

This document explains how to set up and use the Groq AI integration for intelligent, non-dummy chat responses in your Audit Validator.

## ‚ú® What's New

- **Real AI Responses**: No more dummy or fake chat responses
- **Intelligent Analysis**: AI analyzes your validation results and provides actionable insights
- **Security Expertise**: AI acts as an expert IT security analyst
- **Context-Aware**: Responses are based on your actual validation data

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, ensure you have all required packages:

```bash
pip install flask requests pandas pyyaml openpyxl
```

### 2. Get Your Groq API Key

1. Go to [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)
2. Sign up or login to your account
3. Navigate to the API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key (it starts with `gsk_`)

### 3. Configure API Key

#### Option A: Use the Setup Script (Recommended)
```bash
cd audit_validator
python setup_groq.py
```

The script will:
- Check your dependencies
- Guide you through API key setup
- Update your configuration automatically

#### Option B: Manual Configuration
Edit `config.py` and replace the API key:

```python
GROQ_API_KEY = "gsk_your_actual_api_key_here"
```

#### Option C: Environment Variable
Set an environment variable:

```bash
# Windows
set GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_actual_api_key_here

# Linux/Mac
export GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 4. Run the Server

```bash
cd audit_validator
python custom_server.py
```

## üéØ How It Works

### AI Chat Features

1. **Real-Time Analysis**: AI analyzes your validation results in real-time
2. **Context-Aware Responses**: Responses are based on your actual configuration data
3. **Security Expertise**: AI provides security insights and recommendations
4. **Actionable Advice**: Specific steps to fix issues and improve security

### Example AI Responses

**User Question**: "What are the critical issues?"

**AI Response**: 
```
Based on your validation results, I've identified 2 critical security issues:

üî¥ **SSH Password Authentication**: 
- Expected: disabled
- Actual: enabled
- Risk: High - allows brute force attacks
- Action: Disable password auth, use key-based authentication

üî¥ **TLS Certificate Expiry**:
- Expected: >30 days remaining
- Actual: 10 days remaining
- Risk: High - service disruption
- Action: Renew certificate immediately

**Priority**: Address these within 24-48 hours to prevent security breaches.
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Options

### AI Chat Settings (config.py)

```python
# Response length and creativity
MAX_TOKENS = 800          # Longer, more detailed responses
TEMPERATURE = 0.2         # More focused, less random
TIMEOUT = 30             # API call timeout in seconds

# Groq Model
GROQ_MODEL = "llama-3.1-8b-instant"  # Fast, accurate model
```

### Customizing AI Behavior

You can modify the system prompt in `custom_server.py` to change how the AI behaves:

```python
system_prompt = """You are an expert IT security analyst and configuration auditor. You analyze configuration validation results and provide:

1. **Clear Analysis**: Explain what the validation results mean
2. **Risk Assessment**: Identify security and compliance risks
3. **Actionable Recommendations**: Provide specific steps to fix issues
4. **Best Practices**: Suggest security improvements
5. **Priority Guidance**: Help prioritize which issues to fix first

Be specific, technical, and actionable. Use the validation data to give precise advice."""
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'"**
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

2. **"Groq API error: HTTP 401"**
   - Check your API key is correct
   - Ensure the key starts with `gsk_`
   - Verify your Groq account is active

3. **"Groq API error: HTTP 429"**
   - You've hit the rate limit
   - Wait a few minutes and try again
   - Consider upgrading your Groq plan

4. **AI responses seem generic**
   - Check that validation has been run
   - Ensure configuration files are uploaded
   - Verify the AI has access to validation results

### Debug Mode

The server runs in debug mode by default. Check the console output for:
- API call details
- Response lengths
- Error messages
- Configuration status

## üìä What You'll See

### Before (Dummy Responses)
- Generic, non-specific answers
- No real analysis of your data
- Static, pre-written responses

### After (Real AI)
- Specific analysis of your validation results
- Actionable security recommendations
- Context-aware responses
- Professional security insights

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Run the setup script**: `python setup_groq.py`
2. **Start the server**: `python custom_server.py`
3. **Upload a configuration file**
4. **Run validation**
5. **Ask the AI questions about your results**

## üí° Pro Tips

- **Be Specific**: Ask specific questions like "What are the critical issues?" instead of "What's wrong?"
- **Use Context**: The AI works best when you have validation results to analyze
- **Follow Up**: Ask follow-up questions based on AI recommendations
- **Export Results**: Use the export feature to save AI insights

## üÜò Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the console output for error messages
2. Verify your API key is correct
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed
4. Check that validation has been run

**Enjoy your intelligent, AI-powered configuration validation! üéâ**
